title: "About Me"
---

I am a third-year computer science student at Georgia Tech. My classes are focused on [Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/intelligence) and [Systems and Architecture](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/systems-architecture). This means that I have taken courses in machine learning, artificial intelligence, assembly, computer architecture and more. Although I am not a web designer, I took the time to develop this site because I love to learn new things. I originally developed this website the first couple of months of college, but overtime I have been expanding it. The most recent additions were are the animations which I so enjoy watching!

The purpose of this website is to highlight some of the projects I have been working on and for me to just learn about new things like React and Gatsby which is the backbone of the website. Developing these pages also gives me a reason to flesh out projects and to create a space for them to live.
