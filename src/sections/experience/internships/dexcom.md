- The first year I prototyped some features for the next generation Continuous Glucose Monitoring system using AndroidX and CameraX libraries.
- I learned all about how production code is developed, specifically in the highly regulated field of a medical device company.
- The second year, online due to COVID-19, forced me to learn more about remote working flows. Instead of being able to walk over to somebody's desk, or eat lunch with somebody, I instead had to learn how to contact people using Slack and email. Being online caused me to be more independent as the other people of the company were still learning how to communicate effectively while working remote.
- In 2020, I designed and implemented Android libaries using Android MVVM architecture and integrated them into the Dexcom app. The main project was a feature that enabled the app to communicate with a server to obtain messages. I worked alongside the architecture and software development teams to push ideas through the approval process and then turn those ideas into in-app features.
