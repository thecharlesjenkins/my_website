I am in the RoboJackets RoboRacing club writing code for an autonomously racing robot. We are a team of students of all different majors to design, build, wire, and program the robot. My role is to program the robot to drive around the track without a human controller. Some of the projects I have worked on have been detecting the locations of the other robots using computer vision and dynamically generating a map of the race track by using sensory inputs to discover cones and connecting them into walls.
